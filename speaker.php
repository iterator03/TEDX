“A day can never be too long but is in general too short.” This self-made quote at least counts for this man. Dhairya Dand is an award winning researcher, engineer and designer based in NYC and Seattle where he runs oDD - a futurist factory X lab. His current work investigates the human body as a medium for computation, new materials as a tool to embody interactions and design as a vehicle for mindfulness. Dhairya likes to investigate and observe his environment, which makes him generate quite unusual ideas. Those ideas result in impressive inventions and possibilities which include bio reactive architecture, elastic computer screens, shape changing gadgets, shoes that tickle and guide, alcohol aware ice cubes, synthetic muscles, programmable hair… to be continued. He previously was a researcher at MIT Media Lab, amateur geologist in Saudi, toy designer in Singapore, sensory researcher in Tokyo, political activist in Bombay, student at MIT and Harvard.
